<p><strong>Country-wise Insights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which nation is claiming to be the dominant one in North America?</strong></p>
<p>"Substantial Revenue Share to Be Held by the United States"</p>
<p>Due to the high incidence of obesity and the rising prevalence of cardiovascular illnesses, the United States is expected to account for a large portion of the global market for atherosclerosis drug shipments during the forecast period. Other factors that are projected to support market expansion in the nation throughout the forecast period include ageing populations, sedentary lifestyles, poor eating habits, and the expanding availability of medications to treat atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>According to data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, around 805,000 Americans get a heart attack year and one person dies in the US from cardiovascular disease every 34 seconds.</p>
<p>Future atherosclerosis medication sales in the US may benefit from supportive programmes to advance medical research as well as the introduction of advantageous insurance and reimbursement regulations. Future prospects for the nation's producers of atherosclerosis medications are expected to be enhanced by rising public knowledge of the condition and the advent of innovative therapies.</p>
